        GRALE - Geospatial Request and Log Extraction

        The GRALE module contains functions and classes to standardize requests
        sent to geospatial REST API's. Response data, metadata capture, and 
        logging information are also standardized to create efficiencies as a 
        preliminary step in ETL workflows that involve geospatial REST API's.  
        Advanced options are available to optimize speed and memory 
        usage in the extraction phase of ETL workflows. Options include
        multi-threaded request/response cycles, 'low memory' options in 
        an effort to reduce memory usage/errors and storage capacity required 
        for outputs, and .p12/PFX credentialing support.  

        *Note: 0.0.1 Capabilities are limited to get requests on ArcGIS REST API's 
            feature and map services at this time.
